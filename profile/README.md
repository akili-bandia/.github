# Akili Bandia

Akili *(ya)* Bandia is a research studio working with machine learning as a cultural, historical, and political material.

*Akili bandia* literally means artificial intelligence in Swahili, but it also names something made, provisional, and imitative. Something that performs intelligence without claiming to be natural, complete, or *halali*.

The studio embraces this condition. It explores intelligence as practice under uncertainity, shaped by care, refusal, improvisation, and imagination, especially in contexts marked by protest, language, surveillance, and uneven risk.

Based in Nairobi, Akili Bandia moves across code, maps, texts, simulations, and visual artifacts, treating computation as partial, situated, and learned through doing. Research here begins from attention, not mastery.

## Practice

Akili Bandia develops projects where machine learning intersects with:

- uncertainty, risk, and navigation

- protest, surveillance, and cartography

- African languages and cultural datasets

- privacy, obfuscation, and refusal

- archives, history, and computational memory

Research here is treated as a form of making, drawing from artistic, speculative, and technical methods. Models are not only evaluated for accuracy, but for what they make visible, what they erase, and who they are designed to protect.

## Orientation

We are drawn to research that is:

  **Situated:**
Grounded in specific places, histories, and political conditions rather than abstract benchmarks.

  **Process-forward:**
Thinking is logged as it unfolds. Ambiguity, failure, and revision are part of the work.

  **Ethically bounded:**
Privacy and safety shape method and form from the outset.

  **Culturally read:**
Technical systems are approached as cultural artifacts with social and historical consequences.

## Research Threads

Current and recent work explores:

- protest navigation and risk-aware routing in Nairobi’s CBD

- privacy-preserving systems for high-risk environments

- uncertainty-aware modeling and simulation

- language identification for African languages

- computational engagements with archives and anti-colonial history

Projects range from technical prototypes to visual and textual artifacts.

## Current Projects

### Nairobi Protest Navigation Systems
Risk-aware, privacy-preserving navigation models for protest contexts, combining simulation, uncertainty modeling, and ethical constraint.

### Flan Kimathi
A historically grounded question-answering system trained on archival material from the 1956 trial of Dedan Kimathi. The project examines hallucination, voice, authorship, and computational memory.

### Face Obfuscation Evaluation
A framework for assessing face obfuscation techniques from the perspectives of activists, journalists, and people operating under surveillance.

### African Language Identification
Language identification and retraining systems centered on under-resourced African languages and the politics of classification.

### Khanga
A cultural web project tracing the history, symbolism, and social circulation of khangas.

## Outputs

Akili Bandia produces research artifacts, technical prototypes, maps, simulations, visual studies, and texts.

Some projects are deliberately open. Others remain partial or constrained where exposure introduces risk. Where we withhold code or data, each project gets an `ACCESS.md` that explains why and how a trusted researcher can request deeper access.
